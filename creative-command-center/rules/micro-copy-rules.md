# ✍️ MICRO-COPY & UI TEXT RULES

## PURPOSE

Every word on the site is design. 

This document ensures ALL text—buttons, labels, errors, empty states, tooltips—follows brand voice and avoids generic patterns.

---

## SECTION 1: CTA BUTTON TEXT

### Universal Forbidden CTAs

**NEVER use these on ANY empire site:**

```
FORBIDDEN (Generic):
- "Learn More"
- "Read More" 
- "Click Here"
- "Submit"
- "Get Started"
- "Sign Up"
- "Download"
- "Buy Now"
- "Order Now"
- "Shop Now"
- "Continue"
- "Next"
- "Go"
```

**Why forbidden:** Everyone uses these. They communicate nothing. They're forgettable.

### CTA Voice Principles

```
1. ACTION-ORIENTED but INVITING
   Bad: "Submit" (clinical)
   Bad: "Learn More" (vague)
   Good: "Start Your Journey" (inviting + specific)

2. OUTCOME-FOCUSED
   Bad: "Sign Up" (what they do)
   Good: "Join the Circle" (what they get)

3. BRAND-VOICED
   Bad: Generic applies anywhere
   Good: Only makes sense for THIS brand
```

```

```

  - Mythology: "Search myths, legends, deities..."
NOT: "Search" or "Type to search" (generic)
```

```
1. HELPFUL, not blaming
   Bad: "Invalid input"
   Bad: "You entered an invalid email"
   Good: "That doesn't look like an email address"

   Good: "Couldn't send. Check your connection and try again."

```

## SECTION 4: EMPTY STATES

### Empty State Principles

```
1. OPPORTUNITY, not dead-end
   Bad: "No results"
   Good: "No results yet—try different keywords?"

2. GUIDANCE included
   Bad: "Your cart is empty"
   Good: "Your cart is empty. Browse our guides to get started."

3. BRAND VOICE maintained
   Even empty states should sound like the brand
```

### Empty State Library

**Search - No Results:**
```
Witchcraft:
  Headline: "The cards reveal nothing for that query"
  Body: "Try different keywords, or explore our popular spells"
  CTA: "Browse All Spells"

SmartHome:
  Headline: "No devices found matching that search"
  Body: "Try broader terms or browse by category"
  CTA: "Browse Categories"

Mythology:
  Headline: "The archives hold no matching scrolls"
  Body: "Perhaps try different terms, or explore by culture"
  CTA: "Browse by Culture"

Family:
  Headline: "We couldn't find what you're looking for"
  Body: "Try different words, or browse our topics"

```

**No Comments Yet:**
```

  "Be the first to share your wisdom with the coven"

SmartHome:
  "No comments yet. Share your experience!"

Mythology:
  "No scholars have commented yet. Share your knowledge?"

Family:
  "No comments yet. We'd love to hear from you!"
```

**Empty Favorites/Saved:**
```
Witchcraft:
  "Your grimoire is empty. Save spells as you discover them."

SmartHome:
  "No saved items yet. Bookmark devices you're considering."

Family:
  "Nothing saved yet. Heart articles to find them here later."
```

---

## SECTION 5: SUCCESS MESSAGES

### Success Message Principles

```
1. CELEBRATE appropriately
   Overkill: "AMAZING! YOU DID IT! 🎉🎉🎉"
   Too flat: "Submitted."
   Right: "You're in! Check your email to confirm."

2. SET EXPECTATIONS
   Bad: "Success!"
   Good: "You're subscribed! First email arrives Monday."

3. GUIDE next action
   Bad: "Thank you."

```

```

---

## SECTION 6: NAVIGATION LABELS

### Navigation Principles

```
1. CLEAR > Clever
   Bad: "The Vault" (for resources)
   Good: "Resources" or "Free Guides"

2. SCANNABLE
   One-two words preferred
   Action-oriented when possible

3. CONSISTENT across site
   Don't call it "Articles" in nav and "Blog" in footer
```

### Navigation Label Patterns

**Main Navigation (keep short):**
```
Good: "Guides" "Tools" "About" "Blog"
Bad: "Our Comprehensive Guides" "Essential Tools" "About Us" "Blog Posts"
```

**Site-Specific Navigation:**

```
WitchcraftForBeginners:
  Main: Begin Here | Spells | Moon Magic | Tools | About
  NOT: "Home" (everyone has Home, it's meaningless)
  Begin Here → Beginner's starting point
  
SmartHomeWizards:
  Main: Guides | Reviews | Best Of | About
  NOT: "Blog" (too generic)
  
MythicalArchives:
  Main: Archives | Cultures | Creatures | Explore
  NOT: "Categories" (too technical)

Family-Flourish:
  Main: Start Here | Topics | Resources | About
  NOT: "Blog" "Articles" (generic)
```

### Footer Navigation

```
Organized by purpose:

Column 1: Site Navigation (repeat main nav)
Column 2: Popular/Featured
Column 3: Resources/Help
Column 4: Legal (Privacy, Terms, etc.)

NOT: 5 identical columns with random links
```

---

## SECTION 7: TOOLTIPS & HELP TEXT

### Tooltip Principles

```
1. SUPPLEMENT, don't replace labels
   Tooltips should add info, not be required to understand

2. BRIEF
   Max 1-2 sentences

3. APPEAR on hover/focus, not blocking
```

### Tooltip Examples

```
Password strength indicator:
  Weak: "Add numbers or symbols for a stronger password"
  Good: "That's a solid password 👍"
  Strong: "Very secure!"

Form field help:
  Phone: "Optional—we only use this for order updates"
  URL: "Include https:// for external links"
  
Feature explanation:
  "✨" icon: "This is a featured article"
  "🌙" icon: "Best performed during full moon"
```

---

## SECTION 8: LOADING & WAITING STATES

### Loading State Principles

```
1. ACKNOWLEDGE the wait
   Something should happen immediately

2. COMMUNICATE progress (if possible)
   "Loading..." vs "Loading articles..." vs "Loading 3 of 10..."

3. BRAND the wait (if longer than 2s)
   Loading animations should match brand
```

### Loading Text Patterns

```
Generic loading:
  "Loading..." (acceptable but bland)

Site-specific loading:
  Witchcraft: "Consulting the spirits..." or "Gathering the ingredients..."
  SmartHome: "Connecting..." or "Syncing..."
  Mythology: "Searching the archives..."
  Family: "Finding what you need..."

Progress indication:
  "Loading articles (3 of 10)..."
  "Almost there..."
  "Just a moment more..."
```

---

## SECTION 9: CONFIRMATION DIALOGS

### Confirmation Principles

```
1. CLEAR action and consequence
   Bad: "Are you sure?" (sure about what?)
   Good: "Delete this comment? This can't be undone."

2. ACTION-LABELED buttons
   Bad: "OK" / "Cancel"
   Good: "Delete Comment" / "Keep It"

3. SAFE default highlighted
   The non-destructive option should be primary
```

### Confirmation Patterns

```
Delete confirmation:
  Title: "Delete this [item]?"
  Body: "This action cannot be undone."
  Buttons: [Cancel] [Delete] ← destructive is secondary/red

Unsaved changes:
  Title: "You have unsaved changes"
  Body: "Leave without saving?"
  Buttons: [Stay] [Leave]

Unsubscribe:
  Title: "We're sorry to see you go"
  Body: "You'll no longer receive our [frequency] emails."
  Buttons: [Stay Subscribed] [Unsubscribe]
```

---

## SECTION 10: ACCESSIBILITY TEXT

### Alt Text Principles

```
1. DESCRIBE the image purpose
   Not: "Image of woman"
   Yes: "Woman arranging candles on altar"

2. CONTEXT matters
   Decorative images: alt="" (empty, not missing)
   Informative images: Describe content
   Functional images: Describe function

3. NO "image of" or "picture of"
   Screen readers already announce it's an image
```

### Screen Reader Text

```
Skip link:
  "Skip to main content"

Read more (when hidden):
  <span class="sr-only">about [article title]</span>

Icon buttons:
  <button aria-label="Close menu">
  <button aria-label="Search">
  <button aria-label="Share on Twitter">

External links:
  <a>Resource Name <span class="sr-only">(opens in new tab)</span></a>
```

---

## SECTION 11: TIME & DATE FORMATTING

### Time Display Patterns

```
Recent (within 24h):
  "2 hours ago" / "Just now" / "Yesterday"

Within year:
  "March 15" (no year needed)

Older:
  "March 15, 2024"

NOT:
  "03/15/24" (ambiguous)
  "15 March 2024" (inconsistent)
```

### Reading Time

```
Format: "X min read"
Position: Near title/date

Example:
  "5 min read" NOT "5 minute read" or "5 mins"
```

---

## SECTION 12: NUMBERS & DATA

### Number Formatting

```
Large numbers:
  1,234 (with comma)
  1.2K (for 1,200+)
  1.2M (for millions)

Percentages:
  15% (no decimal unless meaningful)
  15.5% (when precision matters)

Currency:
  $19.99 (always two decimals for prices)
  $20 (acceptable for round numbers in content)
```

---

## MICRO-COPY CHECKLIST

Before finalizing ANY text:

```
□ Is it brand-voiced? (Sounds like this site specifically)
□ Is it action-oriented? (When applicable)
□ Is it specific? (Not generic/interchangeable)
□ Is it clear? (No confusion about meaning)
□ Is it kind? (Especially errors)
□ Is it accessible? (Screen reader friendly)
□ Does it avoid forbidden phrases?
□ Would a human write this? (Not robotic)
```

---

## THE MICRO-COPY OATH

> Every word is design.
> Generic text is lazy text.
> Error messages should help, not blame.
> Empty states are opportunities.
> The brand voice never takes a break.
> Even small text deserves attention.
