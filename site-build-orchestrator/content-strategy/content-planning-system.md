## Keyword Research Workflow

### Phase 1: Seed Keyword Generation

```
For each site, generate seeds from:

1. DNA FILE
   - Extract: primary_keywords, secondary_keywords
   - Extract: content_pillars
   - Extract: audience pain points

2. COMPETITOR ANALYSIS
   - Top 5 competitors
   - Their top-ranking keywords
   - Their content gaps

3. AUDIENCE QUESTIONS
   - Google "People Also Ask"
   - Reddit/Quora questions
   - Comment sections
   - Social media questions

4. SEARCH SUGGESTIONS
   - Google autocomplete
   - YouTube autocomplete
   - Amazon search (for product niches)
```

### Phase 2: Keyword Expansion

```
Tools:
- Ahrefs/SEMrush (if available)
- Google Keyword Planner
- Ubersuggest
- KeywordSurfer (Chrome extension)
- AlsoAsked.com

For each seed keyword:
□ Get search volume
□ Get keyword difficulty
□ Find related keywords
□ Find question keywords
□ Find long-tail variations

Output: Master keyword list with metrics
```

### Phase 3: Keyword Categorization

```
Categorize by:

INTENT:
- Informational: "what is...", "how to..."
- Commercial: "best...", "review..."
- Transactional: "buy...", "discount..."
- Navigational: "[brand name]"

DIFFICULTY:
- Easy: KD < 30, can rank quickly
- Medium: KD 30-60, need good content
- Hard: KD > 60, need authority + links

PRIORITY:
- High: High volume + low difficulty + high intent
- Medium: Good volume + medium difficulty
- Low: Low volume OR high difficulty
```

### Phase 4: Keyword Mapping

```
Map keywords to content types:

PILLAR CONTENT (2000-5000 words)
- Primary keyword: High volume, competitive
- Example: "witchcraft for beginners" → Ultimate Guide

CLUSTER CONTENT (1500-2500 words)
- Supporting keywords: Medium volume
- Example: "beginner protection spells" → Tutorial

QUICK WINS (800-1500 words)
- Long-tail keywords: Low volume, easy
- Example: "simple candle spell for confidence" → How-to

FAQ/SNIPPET TARGETS
- Question keywords
- Example: "is witchcraft dangerous" → FAQ section
```

## Pillar-Cluster Architecture

│   └── 1500-2500 words
│
├── CLUSTER 2: "[Subtopic B]"
│   ├── Links to pillar
│   ├── Links to related clusters
│   └── 1500-2500 words
