    "person": "A 55-year-old professor of comparative mythology with wild gray hair and kind eyes. They've traveled to study traditions firsthand, speak multiple languages, and light up when discussing any culture's stories. Their office is filled with artifacts, books in various languages, and hand-drawn maps. They treat a student's question about Percy Jackson with the same respect as a doctoral thesis inquiry.",
    "place": "A vast private library in an old university building. Dark wood shelves reaching to high ceilings. Leather-bound volumes in dozens of languages. A large globe that shows ancient trade routes. Artifacts in glass cases from cultures around the world. Soft light from green banker's lamps. The smell of old paper and possibility.",

    "season": "Autumn—the time of harvests, reflection, when the veil between worlds grows thin in Celtic tradition, appropriate for studying the old ways.",
    "sound": "Pages turning. Distant clock ticking. Perhaps rain against leaded windows. Occasionally, the scratch of pen on paper. Profound, comfortable silence.",
    "texture": "Aged leather book bindings. Smooth vellum. Rough stone artifacts. The weight of a heavy tome in your hands.",
    "smell": "Old books. Leather. Wood polish. Perhaps incense from far-off lands. Coffee from the professor's cup.",
    "taste": "Strong coffee. Perhaps tea with honey. The imagined taste of ancient feasts described in texts.",
