    "person": "A wise woman in her 40s-50s who has practiced for decades. Silver streaks in dark hair, warm eyes that have seen much. She welcomes you into her cottage filled with herbs, books, and candles. She speaks slowly, thoughtfully, and never rushes. She remembers her own beginning and treats your questions with respect.",
    "place": "A candlelit study in an old cottage. Bookshelves line the walls, filled with leather-bound volumes and glass jars of herbs. A fire crackles low. Dried flowers hang from wooden beams. Moonlight filters through leaded glass windows. It smells of sage, old paper, and beeswax.",
    "time_of_day": "The blue hour—just after sunset when the veil between day and night is thin. The moment when candles become necessary and shadows become interesting.",
    "season": "Late autumn, when the world turns inward. Leaves have fallen, nights are long, the time for introspection and study has arrived.",
    "sound": "A fire crackling softly. Pages turning. Wind chimes in the distance. A cat purring. Occasional owl. No modern sounds—no notifications, no traffic.",
    "texture": "Aged leather book covers, smooth from centuries of hands. Rough-woven linen. Warm candle wax. Cool crystal. Dried herb bundles. Handmade paper.",
    "smell": "Dried lavender and rosemary. Old books. Beeswax candles. Wood smoke. A hint of earth after rain. Chamomile tea.",
    "taste": "Herbal tea with honey. Mulled wine. Dark chocolate. Something comforting and slightly mysterious.",
    "temperature": "Warm from the fire against cool autumn air seeping through old windows. Cozy but not stifling.",
    "weather": "A clear night with visible stars and moon, perhaps with mist settling in the garden.",
    "music_genre": "Ambient/ethereal—artists like Wardruna, Enya's more mystical tracks, or medieval/folk instrumentals. Never modern pop. Never aggressive.",
    "movie": "Practical Magic meets The Secret Garden—mystical but grounded, magical but relatable.",
    "book": "A well-worn grimoire passed down through generations, filled with handwritten notes in the margins from practitioners past."
